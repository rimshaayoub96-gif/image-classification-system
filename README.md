animal image classification system
Project Summary:

This project presents an Animal Image Classification System using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), enhanced with Explainable AI (XAI) and Large Language Model (LLM) explanations. The system classifies images of animals into different categories and provides interpretability through visual explanations and textual reasoning.

Key Features:

CNN-based classification: Automatically extracts features from images and predicts the correct animal class.

Explainable AI (XAI): Grad-CAM highlights regions in the image that influenced the model’s decision.

LLM Integration: Generates natural language explanations to describe why the model predicted a particular class.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizes learning rate, batch size, dropout, and convolutional filters for better performance.

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, sensitivity (recall), specificity, ROC curve, and AUC are used to assess model performance.

User Interface: Provides an interactive GUI via Gradio or Streamlit for image upload, real-time prediction, heatmap visualization, and textual explanation.
